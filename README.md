# BIGINT IN C
C/C++ does not have in-built library for handling large integers like BigInteger in Java.So I tried to implement it myself using Linked List data structure.  

I have implemented methods which can be used to perform some basic mathematical operations listed below:   
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
